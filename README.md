<h1>SIEM Implementation and Security Analysis </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of utilization of complex SPL queries, and development of statistical reports for threat identification and mitigation, including response to a DOS attack and monitoring for brute force attacks


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>SPL</b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Splunk 

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
SIEM (system information and event management) is used by organizations to solve the challenge of monitoring and identifying security incidents.  Organizations detect attacks against their information security assets with a concept called continuous monitoring, or more specifically, information security continuous monitoring (ISCM).
<br />
ISCM is the processes and technologies used to detect information security risks associated with an organization's operational environment in real time.  Organizations consider the following factors when determining security risk priorities: Compliance, Financial impact, Reputational impact and Likelihood of attack.
<br />
Logs are the most common organizational method for monitoring.  A log is a record of an event occurring within a device or a network. here are four main log types used by information security professionals: Operating system logs,Application logs, Networking device logs, and Security device logs.  Log aggregation is the identification and collection of logs from multiple computing sources.  Log parsing is the process of converting the single string of data into fields of structured data.  If we separate the values, we can categorize each field and rearrange them to match a uniform structure, a process known as log normalization. Log correlation identifies security events by using correlation rules.  Correlation rules are the logic used to identify security events.  One of the greatest strengths of SIEM tools is their ability to automate the aggregation, parsing, and normalization process.<br />

Analyzing Splunk's add-ons and apps to determine if any of them will work with your security products:<br />
<br />
- Barracuda Spam and Virus Firewall:  This Technology Addon provides index time parsing and search time extractions (CIM mapping) for the barracuda NGX firewalls.<br /> https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4098 <br />
    - Fortinet IDS: Fortinet FortiGate Add-On for Splunk is the technical add-on (TA) developed by Fortinet, Inc. The add-on enables Splunk Enterprise to ingest or map security and traffic data collected from FortiGate physical and virtual appliances across domains.<br /> https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2846 <br />
    - AWS Web Application Firewall: The purpose of this add-on is to provide value to your AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) logs. This is done by making the logs CIM compliant, adding tagging for Enterprise Security data models, and other knowledge objects to make searching and visualizing this data easy.  https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4714 <br />
    - ZScaler:  The Zscaler App for Splunk provides detailed dashboards and reporting for all Zscaler products using Zscaler Nanolog Streaming and Log Streaming services. The Zscaler App for Splunk can also ingest DLP incident information. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3866 <br />

Here are some types of logs typically integrated into a SIEM and their significance:<br />

Authentication Logs: These logs record user login attempts, successful logins, and failed login attempts. They help detect unauthorized access, brute force attacks, and anomalous login patterns, aiding in user behavior analysis and identifying compromised credentials.<br />

Network Logs: Network logs capture network traffic, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and packet details. Analyzing network logs helps identify suspicious traffic, potential intrusions, and unusual patterns that might indicate malicious activity or vulnerabilities.
<br />
System Logs: These logs provide insights into system activities, including changes to files, configurations, and system events. Monitoring system logs aids in detecting unauthorized access, malware infections, system crashes, and configuration changes that might impact security.<br />

Application Logs: Logs from applications record user activities, errors, and events within specific software or applications. Analyzing application logs helps identify abnormal behavior, application-specific attacks, and potential vulnerabilities.<br />

Security Logs: Security-specific logs contain information related to security events, such as firewall logs, intrusion detection/prevention system logs, antivirus logs, and security policy violations. These logs provide critical information about attempted breaches, malware detections, and security control effectiveness.<br />

Endpoint Logs: Logs from endpoints (e.g., workstations, servers) provide insights into device activities, including software installations, user activities, and system resource usage. Endpoint logs help detect anomalies, malware infections, and potential insider threats.<br />

Cloud Service Logs: With increasing cloud adoption, integrating logs from cloud services (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor) is essential. These logs offer visibility into user activities, access control, and configuration changes within cloud environments.

As the SOC manager at OMP, you are asked to analyze the company's vulnerability scanning logs in order to determine the vulnerabilities of OMP's technical assets. <br />

- To accomplish this, you must design SPL searches to run against the vulnerability scanning log file `nessus.txt`.

- These searches can be used to quickly look up existing vulnerabilities on your operating systems or devices.
<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
Using SPL, design searches to display the following data from the `nessus` logs:
<br />
Display results where OS contains "Linux".

<br />
<br />   
Display results by destionation IP

<br />
<br />
Display results by destination IP
**Hint:** Use wildcards in your searches.

<br />
<br />
The results were then saved as a report.  Based on the report, created the approximate date and time of the attack was on the 23rd at 14:30 <br />

<br />
<br />
It took about 9 hours for systems to recover, from 14:30 to 23:30.

Are We Vulnerable?
Command: source="nessus_logs.csv" host="nessus_logs" sourcetype="nessus_logs.csv" dest_ip="10.11.36.23" severity="critical" | top severity to find the count of critical vulnerabilities using the Nessus data

<br />
An alert was set up to monitor every day to see if this server has any critical vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability exists, an alert will be emailed to soc@vandalay.com.<br />
